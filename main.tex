\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  \noindent After having to read three different books on Human Computer Interaction, this is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of unecessary information and vague or non-existent definitions in the HCI universe apparent in all text books. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design
