\begin{example}[Commands-line in After Effects]
  In Adobe's After Effects by \code{alt} + \code{left-clicking} on an attribute of a layer a text field appears. In this users can type in a composition of (mathematical) functions, such as \code{sin} or \code{wiggle}, to manipulate the attributes value.
