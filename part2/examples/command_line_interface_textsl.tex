\begin{example}[TextSL]
  Second Life is a fully virtual world, that typically is presented and interacted with using a visual rendering of the world. With \emph{TextSL} the same was attempted to be represented merely through text-based input and output, thereby allowing visually impaired to take part in Second Life using screen readers or tactile display.

  While exploring and interacting with the world turned out to be slower, the social interactions, which is are most common in Second Life, were at the same pace as usage through the original interface. \cite{oktay}
