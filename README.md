# Interaction Design in a Nutshell
After having to read three different books on Human Computer Interaction, this is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of unecessary information and vague or non-existent definitions in the HCI universe. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design.

## Contribution
The foundational work for this guide or whatever it becomes has been laid out, but quite a few holes are to be filled. All contributions, big or small, are very much appreciated and you will of course be added in the credits. The following are requirements for a pull-request to be accepted
- The text must be written in english
- The writing should be free of typos, readable, formal and without any profanities
- Citations must be included
- The LaTeX code must adhere to the style of the rest. This way it is consistent, readable, and maintainable.
