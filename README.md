# Interaction Design in a Nutshell
After having to read three different books on Human Computer Interaction, this is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of unecessary information and vague or non-existent definitions in the HCI universe. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design.

## LaTeX Preamble
This project uses my [LaTeX preamble](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/LaTeX-Preamble_and_Examples), which for compilation has to be cloned seperately into a folder at the same level as the root folder of this project.

## Questions and issues
If you find a problem in the text you can either contact me, SSoelvsten, add an issue and/or contribute to the project.

## Contribution
This project is a group effort by the students of Aarhus University and others. Your contributions are very welcome.
