# Interaction Design in a Nutshell
After having to read three different books on Human Computer Interaction, this is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of unecessary information and vague or non-existent definitions in the HCI universe. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design divided into three parts

- Theory : Definition of all the theory, with every concept described and compared to other relevant concepts defined.
- Examples : Examples showing one or two key points from the theory section
- Exercises : Small and focused exercises, such that you can apply and discuss the theory.
