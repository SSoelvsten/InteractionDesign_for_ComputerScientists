# Interaction Design for Computer Scientists
After having to read three different books on Human Computer Interaction, this is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of unecessary information and vague or non-existent definitions in the HCI universe. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design

## Contribution
The foundational work for this guide or whatever it becomes has been laid out, but quite a few holes are to be filled. Any contributions are very much appreciated and you will of course be added in the credits.
