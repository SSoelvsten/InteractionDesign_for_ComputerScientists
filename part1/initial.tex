\subsection{Stages of design}
The grouping of methods, concepts and more makes it seem like the design process is a linear process, which it should not be at all. The design process should as much as possible follow the idea of agile development in section \ref{sec:1_agile}. This means, that no section is ever properly finished, as the designer will keep on going back, but rather the next section is also juggled together with the prior things at the same time.
