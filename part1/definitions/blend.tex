\begin{remark}[Blend] \label{rem:blend} \index{Blend}
  In most practical applications, when a metaphor is used, the final design draws from both the source and the target domain, where some features of the target domain have no equivalent in the source while others are left out of the design. These are hence \emph{blends}, since they draw from at least two domains. \cite[p. 194]{benyon14}
