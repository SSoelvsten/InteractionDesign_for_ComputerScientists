\begin{tool}[Conceptual Scenario] \label{tool:conceptual_scenario} \index{Conceptual Scenario}
  An abstract description of the users and the activities that the system supports. This high form of abstraction is great for imagining solutions in the \emph{Conceptual Design} phase and to condense knowledge in the \emph{understanding} phase (framework \ref{fw:y_model}). Furthermore the level of abstraction defines a domain of reasonable designsolutions without rejecting any reasonable designideas early, which is of great value later in the process. \cite[p. 63]{benyon_14}
