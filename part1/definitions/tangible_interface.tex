\begin{definition}[Tangible Interface] \label{def:tangible_interface} \index{Interface!Tangible}
  A sensor-based interaction, where the manipulation physical objects is coupled together with manipulating digital. The sensors can be embedded in the physical objects manipulated or the surrounding environment.

  Normally a tangible interface uses several physical objects, where the interaction can be designed using the objects affordances in mind to help learning to use the system. The use of physical objects and their relative positioning and state lends itself to many more intricate data representations and interactions than other media. Furthermore a tangible interface lends itself well for a shareable interface (Definition \ref{def:shareable_interface}) \cite[p. 205-206]{rogers}
