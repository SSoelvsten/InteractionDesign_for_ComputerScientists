\begin{method}[QOC]
  The \emph{QOC} works similarly to method \ref{meth:object-action_analysis}. Instead of the trade-offs the designer lists the design \emph{q}uestions raised, the design \emph{o}ptions that can and cannot answer these, and the \emph{c}riteria establised by the scenario. \cite[p. 69]{benyon14}
