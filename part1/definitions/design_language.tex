\begin{definition}[Design Language] \label{def:design_language} \index{Design language}
  As part of \emph{physical} design (section \ref{sec:y_model}) a design language is a cohesive assembly of the following three \cite[p. 203-204]{benyon14}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Set of design elements}: For example colours, styles, and types of interactions, buttons etc.
    \item \emph{Principles of composition}: How the design elements are composited
    \item \emph{Qualifying situations}: How contexts and a change of context affects the principles of composition and the set of design elements.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
