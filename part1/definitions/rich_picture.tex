\begin{method}[Rich Picture] \label{meth:rich_picture} \index{Rich Picture}
  A diagram of the structure of a specific situation by depicting the organisational structure, the different people, and the entities. Relationships and interactions between the different people and entities are included, together with the concerns of the different stakeholders. This helps conceptualize the main features of a solution, as it highlights conflicts and concerns of stakeholders (definition \ref{def:stakeholder}). Furthermore as a rich picture is good for investigating and understanding unstructured domains, then it can be used as part of \emph{understanding} of the problemdomain. \cite[p. 51]{benyon_14}

  Though there is no predefined way how to visualize common entities figure \ref{fig:rich_symbols} contains symbols commonly used.
