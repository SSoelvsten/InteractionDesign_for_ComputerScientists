\begin{method}[Artefact Gathering] \label{meth:artefact_collection} \index{Artefact Collection}
  Collecting artifacts either physically or copied by making a sketch or taking picture of them, if you are unable to retreive the artifact from the site. It is also very important for the designer to ask the users to get a common understanding of the artefact before taking it away from its context and annotating it. \cite[p. 286]{benyon_10}
