\begin{definition}[Affordance] \label{def:affordance} \index{Affordance}
  An attribute of an object, which signals how to use it. We distinguish between two types of affordances.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Real affordances: A property of physical objects, where the affordance is obvious and does not need to be learned.
    \item Perceived affordances: A property of non-physical objects, i.e. virtual interfaces. These do not have the trivial real affordance, meaning they in other words are learned conventions.
    \end{itemize}
    Just as a physical object with easily readable affordances makes it obvious how the object should be used, an interface should attempt to do the same. \cite[p. 30]{rogers}
