  To make use of scenarios throughout all of the design process, they are used as evidence for \emph{claims} of design issues. For this the designs are characterized by their \emph{trade-offs}, consisting of the pros, cons and limitations of using the specific design choices. The writing of claims externalizes the designers thoughts and goals and the trade-offs evaluates the design. \cite[p. 69]{benyon14}
