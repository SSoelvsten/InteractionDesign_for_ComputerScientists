In this part all frameworks, concepts and methods will be defined, compared and criticised. They are simultaneously grouped into the point in development they are to be used, and labelled by the following
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Definition}: Definition of basic underlying vocabulary.

   \item \textbf{Concept}: An abstract idea and/or generalization of repeated human behaviour.

   \item \textbf{Framework}: An abstract conceptual structure, around which a lot of methods are designed.
  
   \item \textbf{Method}: A process to attain knowledge, understanding, and/or conclusions
  
   \item \textbf{Tool}: An entity, which is created to be directly used to inform the later design process. In a lot of ways this overlaps with a method, though the point to stress is that a physical object is created to be directly used, rather than just the conclusions.
\end{itemize}

Today design of interactive systems is centered around the end user and constant reevaluation, which the Y-Model in framework \ref{fw:y_model} reflects perfectly.
