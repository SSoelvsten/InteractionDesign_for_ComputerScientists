\chapter{System development} \label{chap:development}
After some amount of iterations the designers (hopefully) have arrived at a solution, that the users would like to have implemented. At this point code needs to be written and the system developed. There are several approaches to this. Whereas the waterfall method was used a lot in the early years of computers, most developers have moved over to some variant of agile development, as they acknowledge that the requirements for the system may change in many different ways.
