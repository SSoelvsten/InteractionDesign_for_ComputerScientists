\section{Scenario based design} \label{sec:scenario_based_design}
Useful in all four stages of the Y-model (section \ref{sec:y_model}), scenarios and personas are one of the most fundamental and popular techniques to designing interactive systems. \cite[p. 62]{benyon_14}

A central tool used in the scenario based design is also the \emph{persona}, which can especially enhance both concrete scenarios and use cases and in parts also conceptual scenarios and for revising user stories

\input{part1/definitions/persona.tex}

With all four types of scenarios we see all activities of the Y-model are covered. Many user stories show the users needs of the system, abstracted into very few conceptual scenarios defining the vision for the solution. These few then create many concrete scenarios generating concrete solutions, from them many more use cases specifying the exact details of the solution. This relation between the stories, the design process and the Y-model is visualized in figure \ref{fig:scenarios}.
