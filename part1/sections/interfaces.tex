\section{\todo : Interfaces}
With different technology comes many different interfaces

\input{part1/definitions/interface.tex}

Where as classical user interfaces have primarily been focusing on a single user interacting at a time, with the move towards Ubiquitous Computing (\todo ) more focus has been put into interfaces that supports use by multiple users. \cite[p. 157-158]{rogers}

\input{part1/definitions/shareable_interface.tex}

An important aspect of different interfaces and their elements are their \emph{affordances}. Using them can make it much easier for the user to quickly learn the system, while misusing or ignoring them can lead to the user getting confused.

\input{part1/definitions/affordance.tex}

This section is a collection of the many different kinds of interfaces. These interfaces are grouped together, though not too much emphasis should be put into the meaning of the groupings, as they are only meant for the reader to have a better overview. It should also be noted, that a system can be classified as more than one of the interface types at the same time.

\subsection{\emph{Natural} interfaces}
The use of \emph{natural} and \emph{intuitive} to describe an interface is highly discouraged as it will dilude the meaning of these two words. The reason this group of interfaces is named so anyways, is to highlight that these interfaces attempt to provide an interaction that is closer to how humans are used tointeract with the physical world.
