\section{Data Analysis} \label{sec:1_data_analysis}
The main purpose of the data analysis step is to take the data gathered and extract conclusions about the users needs and the criteria for the system to be designed. After having done the analysis, criteria for the system to be designed will be clear to the designer. Furthermore together with the methods below as part of the analysis personas and user stories are created (section \ref{sec:scenario_based_design}), which are valuable tools in the later design process.
