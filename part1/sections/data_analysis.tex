\section{Data Analysis} \label{sec:1_data_analysis}
The main purpose of the data analysis step is to take the data gathered and
extract conclusions about the system to be designed. After having done the
analysis, criteria for the system to be designed will be clear to the designer.
Furthermore in this step a lot of tools such as personas and user stories are
created, which are valuable tools in the later design process.

Since always more knowledge is gained around the field for which you design, it
is normal to turn back to this stage quite a lot to redo or add to prior work.
