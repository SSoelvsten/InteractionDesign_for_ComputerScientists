\section{Envisionment} \label{sec:envisionment}
Ontop of the methods listed below one of the main ways to manifest the design ideas as physical objects is through prototypes. This is such a big subject, that it deserves its own chapter, and hence is described in chapter \ref{chap:prototypes}, specifically section \ref{sec:types_of_prototypes} and \ref{sec:prototypes_filters}. With all of this many different manifestations are at the designer's disposal. Of all these options designers want to pick the one(s) highlighting and focusing on what they currently want to explore while suppress everything unimportant to the questions at hand of the designer. \cite[p. 167]{benyon14}
