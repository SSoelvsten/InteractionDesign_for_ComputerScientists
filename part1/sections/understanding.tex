\section{Understanding} \label{sec:understanding}
As part of the \emph{understanding} phase of the Y-model (framework \ref{fw:y_model}) the designer wants to gain knowledge and insight into the problem domain for which is designed.Gaining such an understanding is twofold: gathering information and making the information easy to manage and understand.

\subsection{Data Gathering} \label{sec:data_gathering}
Many techniques have proven useful for gathering information on the different focuspoints of the designer.

\subsection{Data Analysis} \label{sec:data_analysis}
Sitting with raw and a massive amount of data gathered, the information is too unwieldy for later use. To sift through the information and condense it the methods below have proven useful. After having done the analysis, criteria for the system to be designed will be clear to the designer. Furthermore together with the methods below as part of the analysis personas user stories and personas (tool \ref{tool:user_story}, \ref{tool:persona}) are created, which are invaluable tools in the later design process.

Together with analysing artefacts (model \ref{mod:artefact}) the following four models below are part of \emph{Work modelling}, where the different aspects of the users environment are captured \cite[p. 277]{benyon_10}
