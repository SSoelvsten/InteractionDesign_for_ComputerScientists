\section{PACT} \label{sec:pact} \index{PACT}
To make design human-centred we want to consider the \emph{people} involved, the \emph{activities} in which they are involved, the surrounding \emph{context}, and the \emph{technologies} involved. This framework proposed, furthermore has to account for the activities dictating the requirements of the technologies designed, but furthermore that technologies designed have unforseen impact on the nature of the activities, as shown in figure \ref{fig:activities_and_technologies} \cite[p. 25-26]{benyon_14}

\subsection{People}
% Physical Differences:
%    Different physical characteristics, such as senses, dexterity and disabilities (color blindness)
%    Ergonomics
%       Relationsship between people and environment. Draws on especially anatomy and physiology
%       Ambient Environment (temperature, humidity)
%       Working Environment (Design, safetyissues, hygiene)
%       Makes it possible to distinguish between small and usable and too small and hence unusable
