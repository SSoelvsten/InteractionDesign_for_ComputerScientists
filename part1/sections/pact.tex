To make design human-centred we want to consider the \emph{people} involved, the \emph{activities} in which they are involved, the surrounding \emph{context}, and the \emph{technologies} involved. This framework proposed, furthermore has to account for the activities dictating the requirements of the technologies designed, but furthermore that technologies designed have unforseen impact on the nature of the activities, as shown in figure \ref{fig:activities_and_technologies} \cite[p. 25-26]{benyon_14}
