Pervasive Computing, also known as \emph{Obiquitous} computing, is the concept of freeing the computer from the desktop and integrating it \emph{naturally} into your everyday activities. The end goal would then be to add a digital component to all objects, in so far that the technology somehow enhances the original activity.
