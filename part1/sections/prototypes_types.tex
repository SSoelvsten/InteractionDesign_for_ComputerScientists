\section{Types of prototypes} \label{sec:types_of_prototypes}
Designers differentiate between three different types of prototypes

\input{part1/definitions/lo_fi_prototype.tex}
\input{part1/definitions/hi_fi_prototype.tex}
\input{part1/definitions/video_prototype.tex}

\noindent For all of these types of prototypes they are furthermore seperated into \emph{horizontal} and \emph{vertical} prototypes. While \emph{horizontal} prototypes focus on the encompassing all features of the system with little detail, a \emph{vertical} prototype includes a single or few of all the functions implemented in detail. \cite[p. 179]{benyon14}
