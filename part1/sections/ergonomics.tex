\section{Ergonomics} \label{sec:ergonomics} \index{Ergonomics}
The field of ergonomics explores the relationsship between people and their environment - especially physically, where it draws on anatomy and physiology among many.  With a high focus on creating models, this way ergonomics can make it possible to distinguish between usable and unusable and highlight many flaws in designs otherwise overlooked. In ergonomics we specifically distinguish between two types of influences on the humans productivity and well-being.
