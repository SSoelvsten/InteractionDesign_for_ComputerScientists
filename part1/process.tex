\chapter{Process of human-centred design} \label{chap:process}
\minitoc \newpage

The key for modern design of human-computer interaction is to take the human, their needs and abilities, as a starting point. A designsolution unusable by the intended users is a failure the designer is responsible for. Hence, the core part of successful human-centred design is to constantly evaluate everything, preferably with the stakeholders.

But why even bother going through all the hazzle and ressources and instead just skip everything contained in this book and just make a product? By having the human central in the design will create a product more likely to be widely adopted and used longer, which likely gives a big return on investment. Furthermore several pitfalls in terms of safety and ethics can be circumvented, if the design is human-centred. Furthermore the design of technologies need to accomodate and support human values. \cite[p. 20-22]{benyon14}
