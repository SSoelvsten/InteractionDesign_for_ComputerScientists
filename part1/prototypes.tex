\noindent Prototypes were at first only recognized for being a great tool to evaluate designs with end users, but lately they have also been recognized for their ability to make the designer reflect on their choices and exploring the designspace. \cite[7:2]{lim} Prototypes are used all the way from the earliest design to being the specification for the final system and are hence extremely versatile, effective and a stable tool for the designer. \cite[175]{benyon14}
