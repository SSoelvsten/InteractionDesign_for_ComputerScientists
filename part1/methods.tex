\chapter{Methods and Tools} \label{chap:methods}
This chapter contains specific methods and tools, that can be used for the designer to accomplish their different goals in their design process. These methods are all sorted based on the different activities of the Y-model (section \ref{sec:y_model}) to reflect the main goal of all the methods. While scenarios is a core part of the \emph{Conceptual Design} and prototyping of \emph{Envisionment} both methods are such big subjects that they deserve their own section or chapter and can be found in respectively \ref{sec:scenario_based_design} and \ref{chap:prototypes}.
