In this section all frameworks, concepts and methods will be defined, compared and criticised. They are simultaneously grouped into the point in development they are to be used. This grouping though makes it seem like a design is a linear process, which it is everything but. The design process should as much as possible follow the idea of agile development in concept \ref{conc:agile}. This means, that no section is ever properly finished, as the designer will keep on going back, but rather the next section is also juggled together with the prior things at the same time.
